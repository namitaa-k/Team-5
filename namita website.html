<p>This semester, my main contributions have been to the team website itself. Since I was webmaster, I designed the layout of our website, and moreover, brought a lot of it to reality. Some things that I learned while doing the website were how to put pictures, link the image to go to a certain webpage, make a menu bar, and add varieties of texts. Through these learnings, I made a rough draft of our website and taught my teammates how to add their own images/texts. With the arduino project, I have also learned many new things. Working with arduinos was new to me, but this has pushed me to learn a new skill. Although the first time we tried doing our dice, it didnâ€™t work, I was able to learn more about the parts and how they function in an arduino. Though it was a failure at first, my teammates were able to understand our mistakes and build a newer version. </p>

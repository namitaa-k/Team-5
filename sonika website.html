<h2 style="font-size:200%;text-align: center;">Contributions: In regards to the website I made contributions to the website's foundatios by helping with the layout and design. I helped in the developing of pages and tabs and as well as my personal page. In regards to the game I tested it and provided input for further development. We intially based our game on 2048, but deceided to add a twist by making it 2^3 game, hence a largeer total number. I also helped brainstorm the instructions aspect of the game and I am documenting the  progress that we are making from the beginning. For our last project of the semester our group decided on an Arduino Dice and I took charge. I started off by building a base model and checking the parts and alighment creating a simple LED fixture. Next Pragathi and I worked on the model for the Arduino and began running a code. We will continue the work we are doing so to finish the Arduino dice or we may explore more Arduino projects!
